<h2>What is the difference between HTML and HTML5 for what are the new things in HTML5?</h2>
<p>HTML5 we have a audio video header footer aside this type of semantic tags <br>
    are available in HTML5 previously we were using div and span everywhere.
</p>
<p>
    So if you are using the semantic tags then we can avoid writing an extra line of style.
