<div>
<h1>Object Destruct </h1>
<p>
    I have used the rest and spread operator for that.<br>
Spread Operator allows us to <br>
quickly copy all or part of an existing array or object into another array or object.
<br>
allows us to call a function with any number of arguments and <br>
then access those excess arguments as an array.
